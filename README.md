This repository serves as an easy installer for AeroPy's [XFOIL Module]. All
rights to the [xfoil_module.py] file remain with the original author [Pedro
Leal].

The command to install xfoil_wrapper is as follows:

```bash
pip install xfoil@git+https://github.com/skilkis/xfoil_wrapper.git
```

*Note that currently binaries are only included for the Windows operating
system.*

In the future, code quality updates to make the wrapper more extendible are
planned and a compiled-source implementation similar to that of [xfoil-python]
will be investigated.

If you would like to contribute to this project by adding support for
additional operating systems, please submit a pull request! -->
